9d33a2dae4e0fc19f00b9e95a8c6d545,"On the options on futures contracts, if you guys rolled that position at the beginning, or I guess today, how would the cost compare relative to what you paid last quarter?","Yeah, that's a good question. I think the implied wall in options has actually stayed relatively low, so you're paying that carry cost, and that carry cost comes out of book value. It's been relatively stable over the last two quarters and relatively stable in the last two quarters in terms of our roll cost, if you will.",direct,"Direct: Comparative question answered clearly with ""stable"""
4624a2cfab300272a56fd53165c7c396,Can you give us a little bit more detail on the shelf registration and if there are any plans?,"Yes, happy to do that. So we had a shelf registration statement that we filed in 2019. And under the SEC rules, the S3 registration statement has a life of three years. So I consider it just good practice to always have an available shelf registration statement to take advantage of opportunities if we see them. So it was just a question of renewing that facility right now.",direct,Direct: All parts of the question fully addressed
d672b85c3772310158dad29f1eb3fb2d,"Martin, it makes sense that you're going to be migrating your base over to your HTS network this year. And it looks like some nice, long-term savings from that. Could you give us a sense of what you expect those incremental costs to be this year to migrate your existing base over -- the remainder of your existing base over to the HTS network?","Well, we've been doing it for two years now. So we're basically accelerating what we have been doing. So we'll be offering some incentives in terms of hardware discounts and things like that, installation support. So some of that cost might be capitalized if they move over to AgilePlans, but some of it would show up in product discounts and installation credits.",intermediate,"Intermediate: Asked for numbers, only gave cost type descriptions"
dd836855bf1448becb94b9e33dcbb2ad,"Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly from me, and this is the honest to goodness, last one. I might have missed it, did you give any color as to sort of what you're expecting for SSAT in the second quarter?","I don't think we said anything with regard to the second quarter, but we did say that we expected a very, very busy environment in volume to continue to benefit the joint venture. Obviously that SSAT is a business with relatively large fixed costs and a more volume that you could put over those terminals. It has a very healthy impact to the margins and so we're expecting that business to perform well. I mean we implied that Matson's business group was going to stay busy through Lunar New Year, end of -- toward middle to late October at least, and we expect SSAT to perform well over that same time for a period for the same reasons.",intermediate,"Intermediate: Acknowledged no answer given, only vague direction"
ff7c19bc058e308ebfd5261108d22aa6,"And then as you ramp up production, can you talk a little bit about yield coming off those automated lines and what you're seeing and how much improvement there might be a lot to go in terms of some of the cost reduction and efficiency of that manufacturing.","Yes. So Paul, we're not going to talk openly about our yield. However, I can say that we're seeing, through Jim Barnhart leadership as our COO, we're seeing continuous improvements in our yields.",fully_evasive,"Fully Evasive: Explicit refusal (""we're not going to talk openly"")"
5d7c12120b4aac09e9c91b58abbee93f,"And then just -- and I'd like to get your thoughts here on cash position obviously, in the 2Q is not super enviable. But if -- just looking back at my notes from the last quarter that, that runway appears to have shortened. Just wondering if there's a particular reason for that? And anything you can say about the options you're considering to address?","Yeah. We're not going to comment on that today except for the numbers that David has already presented, Chad. But thank you for your question.

David Kirske -- Chief Financial Officer

And just one point, Chad, in terms of our accelerating costs, that's associated with commercialization as we build on that, that infrastructure.",fully_evasive,"Fully Evasive: Explicit refusal (""We're not going to comment on that today"")"
