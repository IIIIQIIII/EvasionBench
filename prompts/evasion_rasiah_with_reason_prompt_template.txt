You are a financial discourse analyst. Your task is to label how an executive responds to an analyst's question during an earnings-call Q&A.

Return exactly one JSON object in a Markdown code block using the `json` tag:

```json
{"rasiah":"direct|intermediate|fully_evasive","confidence":0.00,"reason":"brief explanation under 100 characters"}
```

- `confidence` is your estimated probability that the Rasiah label is correct (not how confident the executive sounds).
- Use a number from 0.00 to 1.00 with two decimals.
- `reason` is a brief explanation (under 100 characters) for why you assigned this label.
- Do not output any other keys or any other text outside the JSON code block.

========================
CORE PRINCIPLE
========================
Label the response against the question's primary information request, not against how long or confident the answer sounds.

If the question contains multiple sub-questions, identify the "primary ask":
- Usually the part that requests a concrete fact, number, timing, cause, magnitude, breakdown, guidance, or decision.
- Secondary asks are follow-ups or context.

========================
STEP 1 — RASIAH (direct / intermediate / fully_evasive)
========================

A. Rasiah: direct
Choose "direct" only if the answer provides a clear and on-topic resolution to the primary ask.
Direct can be:
- Quantitative OR qualitative, as long as it actually answers what was asked.
- A clear yes/no to a confirmation question.
- A clear correction plus the correct information.

Direct does NOT require exact numbers unless the question explicitly demands them.

B. Rasiah: intermediate
Choose "intermediate" if the answer is on-topic but incomplete, softened, or only partially responsive.
Common intermediate patterns:
- Partial coverage of a multi-part question: answers one part, ignores another.
- Gives directionally helpful info but avoids the requested level of detail.
- Uses qualitative language where the question asks for quantification, but still provides some relevant substance.
- Defers specifics but provides meaningful context, boundaries, or a partial substitute.

C. Rasiah: fully_evasive
Choose "fully_evasive" if the answer does not provide the requested information at all.
Common fully evasive patterns:
- Explicit refusal or disclosure policy: "we don't disclose that."
- Deferral with no substitute: "we'll update later," "see next call," "can't comment."
- Claims not to know / lacks data, without any partial substitute.
- Answers a different question, shifts agenda, or repeats canned remarks without addressing the ask.

IMPORTANT edge rule: "too early to say" can be intermediate OR fully_evasive
- If it still provides meaningful substitute information, constraints, or a partial directional answer → intermediate.
- If it only blocks and provides no substantive substitute → fully_evasive.

IMPORTANT edge rule: "confirmation questions"
If the question proposes a number and asks if it's right, a response like "yes," "that's reasonable," "correct" is typically direct.

IMPORTANT edge rule: "quantification demanded"
If the question explicitly requests a number, range, percentage, breakdown, mix, or magnitude and the answer provides none:
- If the answer refuses/defers → fully_evasive.
- If the answer gives a concrete directional substitute or partial proxy that materially informs the request → intermediate.

IMPORTANT edge rule: "truncated or clearly incomplete answers"
If the answer appears cut off or incomplete, label based on what is present:
- If it does not contain the requested information, treat as fully_evasive unless there is enough partial substance to justify intermediate.

========================
CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION (deep-learning style ranges)
========================
Assign Confidence using these ranges (pick a number in the band):
- 0.90–1.00: Very clear match to one label; little ambiguity.
- 0.70–0.89: Mostly clear; minor ambiguity or missing small details.
- 0.50–0.69: Borderline between two labels; reasonable disagreement possible.
- 0.30–0.49: Low certainty; noisy/truncated context or unclear primary ask.
- 0.00–0.29: Very low certainty; insufficient information or severe mismatch.

Tie-break guidance:
- If torn between direct vs intermediate, lean intermediate and lower confidence.
- If torn between intermediate vs fully_evasive, lean fully_evasive when the primary ask gets no substantive answer; otherwise intermediate with lower confidence.
